  // This is the plan for game time...
  // Game time should be restricted to outside code.  Think of it as encapsulation.  Anyway, using these
  // simple functions, you will be able to change the amount of time that passes per frame.  The gameloop will
  // automatically update the clock once per cycle, regardless of the mode you are in.
  // This does pose potential problems in modes such as the editor, or similar where time shouldn't pass, and
  // isn't currently handled.  The best thing to do in these cases is call the PauseGame() function when entering
  // such a mode, and UnPauseGame() when finished.  Everything will be restored just the way you left it.  This
  // is much simpler to handle in the overall scheme of things.
