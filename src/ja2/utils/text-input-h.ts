  // NEW CHANGES:  January 16, 1998
  // I have added the ability to stack the text input modes.  So, if you have a particular
  // screen that has fields, then somehow, hit a key to go into another mode with text input,
  // it will automatically disable the current fields, as you go on to define new ones.  Previously,
  // you would have to make sure the mode was removed before initializing a new one.  There were
  // potential side effects of crashes, and unpredictable results, as the new fields would cook the
  // existing ones.
  // NOTE:  You may have to modify you code now, so that you don't accidentally kill a text input mode
  // when you don't one to begin with.  (like removing an already deleted button).  Also, remember that
  // this works like a stack system and you can't flip through existing defined text input modes at will.

  // NOTES ON LIMITATIONS:
  //	-max number of fields 255 (per level)
  //  -max num of chars in field 255

  // These are the definitions for the input types.  I didn't like the input filter idea,
  // and the lack of freedom it gives you.  This method is much simpler to use.
  // NOTE:  Uppercase/lowercase filters ensures that all input is either all uppercase or lowercase
  // NOTE:  Feel free to expand this to your needs, though you also need to support it in the filter
  //			 section.
  export const INPUTTYPE_NUMERICSTRICT = 0x0001; // 0-9 only, no minus signs.
  export const INPUTTYPE_ALPHA = 0x0002; // a-z A-Z
  export const INPUTTYPE_SPACES = 0x0004; // allows spaces in input
  export const INPUTTYPE_SPECIAL = 0x0008; //  !@#$%^&*()_+`|\[]{};':"<>,./? (spaces not included)
  export const INPUTTYPE_UPPERCASE = 0x0010; // converts all lowercase to uppercase
  export const INPUTTYPE_LOWERCASE = 0x0020; // converts all uppercase to lowercase
  export const INPUTTYPE_FIRSTPOSMINUS = 0x0002; // allows '-' at beginning of field only
  const INPUTTYPE_SPECIALCHARS = INPUTTYPE_SPECIAL | INPUTTYPE_SPACES;
  const INPUTTYPE_ALPHANUMERIC = INPUTTYPE_ALPHA | INPUTTYPE_NUMERICSTRICT;
  export const INPUTTYPE_ASCII =
    INPUTTYPE_ALPHANUMERIC | INPUTTYPE_SPECIALCHARS;

  // DON'T GO ABOVE INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_BASEVALUE FOR INPUTTYPE MASKED VALUES LISTED ABOVE!!!
  export const INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_BASEVALUE = 0x1000; // increase this value if necessary

  // Exclusive handlers
  // The dosfilename inputtype is a perfect example of what is a exclusive handler.
  // In this method, the input accepts only alphas and an underscore as the first character,
  // then alphanumerics afterwards.  For further support, chances are you'll want to treat it
  // as an exclusive handler, and you'll have to process it in the filter input function.
  export const enum Enum383 {
    INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_DOSFILENAME = 0x1000 /* INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_BASEVALUE */,
    INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_COORDINATE,
    INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_24HOURCLOCK,
    // INPUTTYPE_EXCLUSIVE_NEWNEWNEW, etc...
  }

  // A hybrid version of InitTextInput() which uses a specific scheme.  JA2's editor uses scheme 1, so
  // feel free to add new color/font schemes.
  export const enum Enum384 {
    DEFAULT_SCHEME,
  }

  // This allows you to insert special processing functions and modes that can't be determined here.  An example
  // would be a file dialog where there would be a file list.  This file list would be accessed using the Win95
  // convention by pressing TAB.  In there, your key presses would be handled differently and by adding a userinput
  // field, you can make this hook into your function to accomplish this.  In a filedialog, alpha characters
  // would be used to jump to the file starting with that letter, and setting the field in the text input
  // field.  Pressing TAB again would place you back in the text input field.  All of that stuff would be handled
  // externally, except for the TAB keys.
  export type INPUT_CALLBACK = (a: UINT8, b: boolean) => void;
  // INPUT_CALLBACK explanation:
  // The function must use this signature:  void FunctionName( UINT8 ubFieldID, BOOLEAN fEntering );
  // ubFieldID contains the fieldID of that field
  // fEntering is true if you are entering the user field, false if exiting.
